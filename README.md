📘 Project: Cloud-Based IoT System Architecture Model
Author

Mateusz Cieślak

Project Description

This repository contains a complete set of design and implementation materials for a cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) system architecture.
The project covers device-level data acquisition, network communication, and integration with cloud infrastructure.

The solution is designed as a conceptual and partially implemented model, combining architectural documentation, device code, sample data, and cloud infrastructure defined using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
